# E-commerce Store React Application

## Prompt

Your task is to create a React application that mimics an e-commerce store. The application should have the following features:

1. Home Page: Create a home page that displays the main content of your e-commerce store. This page should serve as the landing page when the application is loaded.

2. Products Page: Implement a products page that shows a list of products available in your store. Each product should be displayed with a title, description, and a button to view more details.

3. Product Card Page: When a user clicks the "View More" button on the products page, they should be taken to a product card page that displays more details about the selected product. This page should show additional information such as price, images, and any other relevant details. Additionally, there should be an "Add to Cart" button that allows users to add the product to their shopping cart.

4. Cart Page: Create a cart page that displays all the items that have been added to the shopping cart. This page should show the product name, price, quantity, and a total cost of all the items in the cart.

You should use React Router to handle the navigation between different pages of the application. React state should be utilized to manage the data and state changes within the components.

Feel free to be creative with the design and styling of your e-commerce store. You can use placeholder data or mock API calls to populate the product information for now.

Remember to break down your application into reusable components and follow best practices for code organization, readability, and maintainability.

Good luck and have fun building your e-commerce store!
